# Simulating sea shell patterns and fractal pendula 

This is a collection of interactive simulations developed for a workshop held during several open-door events at the Physics Institute of the University of Cologne.  

The workshop aimed to showcase how programming is a valuable everyday tool for physicists and to spark interest in (computational) physics. It was designed for children aged 10 to 14.  

### Simulations Included  

1. **seashellpattern.jl** – A simulation that allows users to explore how the intricate patterns found on exotic seashells emerge from the simple rules of a one-dimensional cellular automaton.  
2. **magpendulum_demo.jl** – A demonstration of a single magnetic pendulum moving above three fixed magnets.  
3. **magpendulum.jl** – An interactive visualization of the **butterfly effect** and the **exponential sensitivity of trajectories to initial conditions**. It simulates the motion of hundreds of magnetic pendulums, each starting from slightly different initial positions. Users can adjust system parameters such as friction, magnetic strength, and more.  
4. **slides.pdf** – A set of slides from the mini introduction held during the workshop.
